Title : Latest in Pycket: What we are doing and why that is hard.

Abstract: 


One of the main problems of JIT-ing a language using
meta-interpretation is to find the loops in the user program, rather
than the ones in the dispatch loop of the language interpreter. This
problem (among many others) is solved by PyPy, which manages to
perform on average twice as fast as CPython.

What we have in Pycket, is to see if we can do this with another
"meta" level on top, i.e. meta-interpreting a self-hosting interpreter
(you know, the one with the Racket linklets), effectively trying to
push the level in which finding loops is possible. Turns out that's
not the only issue we need to solve to achieve a good performance.

We're going to briefly talk about these problems and I'll explain our
current strategies to solve them.
